# DistPass

### Introduction

This repository contains the practical part that accompanies my Master Dissertation in Computer Science Engineering at the ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon.

This work uses distributed computing in the Web browser and, voluntary computing, to verify the robustness of passwords. It uses a Node.js web server and implements Javascript logic to enable and manage tasks that are distributed and performed by voluntary end users.

### Assumption

It assumed that you have the following technologies installed on your machine so that you can run the DistPass system. 
* [Node.js (server)]( https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [MongoDB (database)](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [crunch (create the world list)](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/crunch)
* [Python (used to create the json file for the dataset)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Content 

This repository divides into five parts which will be described in more detail while following a practical guide.

* [Create the Dataset](https://github.com/lclms/distpass/blob/master/content/create_the_dataset.md)
* [Install the Backend](https://github.com/lclms/distpass/blob/master/content/create_the_dataset.md)
* [Install the Frontend](https://github.com/lclms/distpass/blob/master/content/Install%20the%20Frontend.md)
* [Install the Task Management](https://github.com/lclms/distpass/blob/master/content/Install%20the%20Task%20Management)
* [Examples of usability](https://github.com/lclms/distpass/blob/master/content/Examples%20of%20usability.md)
