This page is intended to introduce some examples of usability

### Home Page

As described in point 3, when you start the frontend, the web browser automatically opens with the DistPass system. The following image illustrates the system home page. On the left side you can see the navigation menus and two buttons on the center that represent the actions that users can take to contribute their hardware. Finally, at the center a list of work that are available to be solved.
